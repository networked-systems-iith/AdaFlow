# AdaFlow
An In-Network cache that is implemented in the data plane for intrusion detection of flow-based attacks. 

## About this repository:
``Control Plane``: contains control plane logic to initialize AdaFlow cache at the very beginning. 

``Data Plane``: contains 4 prototypes to handle attacks based on packet length and IPD distributions, and based on CIC-IDS2017 dataset. Also, it contains Strawman version of Push and Pull Designs. 

``ML Models``: contains 3 types of ML models generated to be deployed on the data plane - Single ML Model, Sequential Multiphase ML Model and Aggregated Multiphase ML Models. All these models are Tree-Based. 

``Remote Server``: contains ``profiler`` to derive configurations for various training dataset. Also contains a complex ML classifier to classify flows in the server. 

``Simulations``: contains simulations of AdaFlow, NetBeacon and *Flow. 

## General Dependencies
1. Make sure you have Tofino 2 and Tofino 1 Models/Hardware (yes, actual switch ðŸ˜œ) Running. Follow this [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gyYWL0HY2SanzAoA6GGRImf9ERR1KXrG0Ngg8Zh5VfA/edit#). 
2. Make sure you have basic python3 libraries like ``sklearn`` and ``hyperopt`` up and running. 

## Using this repository:
1. Collect required PCAP traces in the ``Dataset`` folder.
